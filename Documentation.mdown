## What is it? ##

This plugin adds a new Notify Mediator that can be used to use different Notify mediators based on the notification type

## Usage ##

In the Handlers preference pane, select Notification Hub as the Notify mediator. Then in the Notifiication Hub preference pane you can customize it further.

The Default popup is what Notify Mediator to use if the given notification has no type or isn't in the table.

Hit the add button to add an entry to the table. The first column is the notification type. Double-click to edit to put in a custom type, or click the popup at the right side of the column to select a known type. The second column is the Notify Mediator to use for that notification type.

You can add several entries for a given notification type - each Notify Mediator will be called for that notification.
